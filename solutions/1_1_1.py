# This exercise should be done in the interpreter

# Create a variable and assign it the string value of your first name,
# assign your age to another variable (you are free to lie!), print out a message saying how old you are

name = "John"
age = 21
print "my name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old."


# Use the addition operator to add 10 to your age and print out a message saying how old you will be in 10 years time
age += 10
print name, "will be", age, "in 10 years."
